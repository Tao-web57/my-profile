        <p>
                Hello! my name is Taofeeqah Shokeyo. Few months ago, i had no idea what coding meant, 
            until i stumbled upon SAIL scholarship in full-stack development.I develop a passion 
            for building clean and functional websites using HTML and CSS. 
                I may be at the start of my journey, but i'm driven,focused and ready to bring websites to life-one project at a time. 
        </p>

            My goal? 
            To turn simple ideas into beautiful websites that helps people and businesses grow online.
